# Aryan Patel — Personal Site

A single-page, aurora-inspired portfolio for Aryan Patel's GitHub Pages site. Built with TypeScript for the interactive elements and vanilla CSS for a fully static, deploy-anywhere experience.

## Features

- **Dynamic theming** with a persistent aurora ↔ midnight toggle that respects system preferences.
- **Data-driven rendering** of spotlight cards, journey milestones, and social links through TypeScript modules.
- **Playful interactions** including pointer-based parallax, magnetic card tilts, and rotating highlight text.
- **Responsive layout** tuned for devices from mobile to large desktop displays without external frameworks.

## Development

1. Install dependencies (requires Node.js):

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Compile TypeScript:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   The compiled JavaScript is emitted to `scripts/` for direct use by `index.html`.

3. Open `index.html` in your browser or serve the directory with your favorite static server.
